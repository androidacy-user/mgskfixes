# Magisk Fixes (Unity) 

_If you like my work please feel free to donate to my [PayPal](https://paypal.me/innonetlife). It would mean a lot to me_

## What's this?

This is a small collection of fixes for Magisk. Primarily targeting Motorola devices 
or GSIs. These may be useful in other situations

Admittedly you could move on to these files into place yourself but why would you?
You can do it systemlessly

If you still want to do it systemful just add `-sysover` to the end of the file name (when flashing in TWRP). That's the beauty of Unity

## But @topjohnwu and @phhusson say I shouldn't use Magisk on a GSI!!!! 

Yeah, yeah, yeah. Whatever. So you're device doesn't have many ROMs and you turned to GSI (or the stock one doesn't like Magisk). 
You shouldn't have to give up the great power of Magisk. And we can hardly expect either John Wu or phhusson to try to fix it. Each of them has to use a series of hacks so they'll work on as many devices as possible. So I'm going to try to apply a few more to get it to work and hopefully bring magisk to the masses (OK fine that's an exaggeration) 


## So you're "fixing" Magisk with Magisk?

Yes! Magisk is by nature modular, making things simpler

## Where do I get support?

I highly recommend joining our telegram group [here](https://t.me/inlmagisk)

## Fix {x} is needed on my device

Join the support group and let me know and I'll add it in
